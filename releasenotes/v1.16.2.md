- Updated `ado2gh integrate-boards` command help text to clarify that the ADO PAT token must have 'All organizations' access selected.
- If `create-team` fails with 5xx errors, it will now retry the API call.
- Fixed `gh gei migrate-secret-alerts` command to handle long resolution comments by truncating them to fit within GitHub's 270 character limit while preserving the resolver name prefix.
